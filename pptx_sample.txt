Music Recommendation System – PPTX Outline

1. Title
   - Music Recommendation System
   - Personalized Song Discovery Using Machine Learning
   - Author: arththakkar1

2. Project Overview
   - Full-stack web application for music recommendations
   - Combines Python (Flask) backend and React/Next.js frontend
   - Uses machine learning for content-based filtering and similarity matching

3. Key Features
   - Real-time song search with fuzzy matching
   - Content-based recommendation engine
   - Paginated, grid-based results with duplicate removal
   - Audio feature integration (danceability, energy, valence, etc.)
   - Responsive UI with skeleton loading and caching

4. System Architecture
   - Modular, layered design:
     - Frontend: React/Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
     - API Layer: Flask RESTful endpoints
     - Service Layer: Business logic and orchestration
     - ML Layer: Feature engineering and similarity computation
     - Data Layer: Data loading and preprocessing
   - (Include architecture diagram from README)

5. Data Pipeline
   - Loads Spotify dataset (CSV) with rich metadata
   - Preprocessing and feature extraction
   - Textual features: track name, artist, genre
   - Audio features: danceability, energy, valence, etc.

6. Machine Learning Concepts
   - TF-IDF Vectorization
     - Converts song text to numerical vectors
     - Formula: TFIDF_{t,d} = TF_{t,d} × IDF_t
   - Cosine Similarity
     - Measures similarity between song vectors
     - Formula: cosine_similarity(A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| ||B||)

7. Recommendation Workflow
   1. User selects or searches for a song
   2. Backend vectorizes query and computes similarity scores
   3. Top matches are ranked and filtered for duplicates
   4. Results are paginated and sent to frontend

8. API Endpoints
   - /songs: Random sample of songs
   - /search: Search songs by query
   - /recommend: Get recommendations for a selected song (supports pagination)

9. Frontend Features
   - Responsive grid layout for recommendations
   - Skeleton loading for smooth UX
   - Caching for fast navigation
   - Integration with Flask backend

10. Screenshots
    - (Add screenshots from your screenshots/ folder: Home, Search, Recommendations Grid)

11. Performance Optimizations
    - Backend: In-memory caching, efficient numpy operations
    - Frontend: API response caching, debounced search input

12. How to Run
    Backend:
      - pip install -r requirements.txt
      - flask run
    Frontend:
      - npm install
      - npm run dev

13. Ending
    - Thank you
